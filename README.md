# EthSniperBot
Creating a "sniping" bot smart contract on Ethereum is risky due to anti-bot protections and front-running risks on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). A smart contract can be made to interact with DEXs like Uniswap, but it requires off-chain data analysis and precise transaction timing to function effectively.
